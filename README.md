This repository contains javascript code to draw tanglegrams in a web browser.

This repository is now archived because of security issues with some of the javascript packages used.  Because of these security issues, use at your own risk.


Usage
=======
The javascript app in /public/js/bundle.js is ready to go as-is,
but it must be delivered via a webserver.

## Using the built-in webserver
To use the built-in webserver with TreeTangler, you need to install from https://nodejs.org;
it will autodetect your OS. To launch a webserver on localhost, do ```npm start``` and it will
give you the localhost web address that is running the app.

## Using the command-line tools
The command line tools are available independently at https://github.com/meekrob/cophy-treetools
