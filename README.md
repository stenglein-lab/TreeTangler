# Main
The javascript app in /public/js/bundle.js is ready to go as-is,
but it must be delivered via a webserver.

## Using the built-in webserver
To use the built-in webserver with TreeTangler, you need to install from https://nodejs.org;
it will autodetect your OS. 
To launch a webserver on localhost, do ```npm start```
